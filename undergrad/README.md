# The AutoNateAI Bridge: From Classroom to Career 🎓→💼

You know how to code. You've passed the classes. You've built the projects.

So why does the industry still feel like a mystery?

## What Is This?

A **6-week intensive** designed for CS students who can write code but haven't yet learned to **think like a professional engineer**.

Your professors taught you algorithms. We'll teach you systems.
Your classes gave you syntax. We'll give you strategy.
Your GPA shows you can learn. We'll show you can **ship**.

## Who Is This For?

- CS students (freshman → senior)
- You can write Python, Java, or C++ (we'll use Python here)
- You've taken Data Structures, maybe Algorithms
- You're thinking about internships or full-time roles
- You suspect there's a gap between what you learned and what the job requires

**You're right. There is. Let's close it.**

## The Truth Nobody Told You

| What School Taught | What Industry Needs |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Write algorithms | Read codebases |
| Solve isolated problems | Navigate complex systems |
| Work alone | Collaborate with teams |
| Optimize for grades | Optimize for users |
| Submit and forget | Maintain and iterate |
| Perfect code | Working code, shipped |

## What You'll Build

| Week | Chapter | Project |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | The Stone Remembers | Production Data Layer |
| 2 | Lightning Paths | Event-Driven Pipeline |
| 3 | The Pull Between | API Integration Suite |
| 4 | The Age of Architects | System Design Portfolio |
| 5 | **Capstone I** | Full-Stack Application |
| 6 | **Capstone II** | AI-Augmented Tool |

## After This Course

- A **portfolio** of real projects (not toy assignments)
- Ability to **read and navigate** unfamiliar codebases
- Understanding of **system design** (interview gold)
- Experience working with **AI tools** professionally
- Confidence that you're **job-ready**
