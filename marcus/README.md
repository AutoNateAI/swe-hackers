# Marcus's Workspace 🏗️

Welcome to your personal learning space! This folder is where all your projects, explorations, and assignments live.

## How It Works

```
marcus/
├── README.md              ← You are here
├── systems-thinking/      ← Your first assignment folder
│   ├── diagrams/
│   ├── notes.md
│   └── challenges.md
├── next-project/          ← Future project
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Starting an Assignment

When you get a new card/assignment:

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date
git pull origin main

# Create a folder for the assignment
cd marcus
mkdir systems-thinking
cd systems-thinking
```

### 2. Working on Your Content

Create files for your work - diagrams, notes, code:

```bash
# Create a notes file
touch notes.md

# Create a folder for diagrams
mkdir diagrams
```

For diagrams, you can:
- Use Mermaid in markdown files (renders on GitHub)
- Export from tools like Excalidraw, Miro, etc.
- Sketch on paper and photograph

### 3. Saving Your Progress

Commit early, commit often:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Add system decomposition for Spotify"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 4. Marking Complete

Once you're done:
1. Push your final work
2. Go to the issue/card on GitHub
3. Check off the "Definition of Done" items
4. Add a comment with diagrams, insights, or questions

## Tips

- **Think out loud** - Write down your reasoning, not just conclusions
- **Diagrams > words** - A picture is worth a thousand lines of explanation
- **Question everything** - "Why is it built this way?" is your new favorite question
- **Connect the dots** - Look for patterns across different systems
