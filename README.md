# SWE Hackers 🧑‍💻

A curated collection of software engineering tutorials, resources, and learning paths.

## Repository Structure

```
swe-hackers/
├── README.md           ← You are here
├── brian/              ← Brian's workspace
│   ├── README.md
│   └── [projects]/     ← Assignment folders go here
├── marcus/             ← Marcus's workspace
│   ├── README.md
│   └── [projects]/     ← Assignment folders go here
└── ...
```

Each person has their own folder. Inside your folder, you create a subfolder for each assignment/project.

## How This Works

1. **Cards/Issues** = Assignments with tutorials, challenges, and resources
2. **Project Board** = Track what's in progress, done, or blocked
3. **Your Folder** = Where you do the actual work

Browse the [**Project Board**](https://github.com/users/nathanbaker-ao/projects/1) to see your cards.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo (if you haven't)
git clone https://github.com/nathanbaker-ao/swe-hackers.git
cd swe-hackers

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Go to your folder
cd brian  # or marcus

# Create a project folder for your assignment
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Do your work, then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Complete assignment X"
git push origin main
```

## Workflow

1. **Check the board** → Find your assigned card
2. **Read the card** → Understand the assignment
3. **Create a folder** → In your personal workspace
4. **Do the work** → Code, notes, diagrams
5. **Commit & push** → Save to GitHub
6. **Mark complete** → Check off items on the card
