# SWE Hackers 🧑‍💻

A curated collection of software engineering tutorials, resources, and learning paths.

## How This Works

Each **Issue** in this repository is a learning card containing:
- 📖 Tutorial content in markdown
- 🔗 Links to relevant code repositories
- 🏷️ Labels for categorization (language, difficulty, topic)
- 💬 Discussion in comments

Browse the [**Project Board**](https://github.com/users/nathanbaker-ao/projects/1) to see cards organized by status/category.
