Hiring Manager  Atomic Object  1034 Wealthy Street SE  Grand Rapids, MI 49506
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to submit my application for the Atomic Accelerator at Atomic Object in Grand Rapids. With a strong foundation in computer science, I am eager to contribute to a team that builds custom software solutions that are not only technically excellent, but also thoughtfully designed for users, clients, and communities alike. Atomic’s reputation for craftsmanship, collaboration, and community impact resonates strongly with my own professional values.
Over the course of my 3+ years in imaging, css,html c#, I have developed a deep appreciation for companies that focus on quality and long-term value. Atomic Object’s approach to custom software — working closely with clients from early conceptual phases through delivery — mirrors my belief that great software is born from empathy, clear communication, and iterative problem solving.
In my most recent role at MCPC, I was responsible for imaging mini desktops and laptops for Meijer, along with helping update the hospitals all to epic. I collaborated effectively with cross-functional teams, delivered solutions that balanced business needs with user experience, and consistently sought new ways to improve both processes and outcomes. I am confident that this experience has prepared me to thrive as part of Atomic’s multidisciplinary teams of designers, developers, and delivery leads.
What particularly draws me to Atomic Object is its employee-owned structure and intentional workplace culture. Being part of a company where everyone has a stake in the success of the work and where transparency and continuous learning are valued is something I find deeply motivating. I am also impressed by Atomic’s engagement with emerging technologies like AI to help clients innovate responsibly and intelligently.
I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills and passion for software that makes a meaningful impact. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support Atomic Object’s goals and contribute to creating exceptional products with your talented team.
Sincerely, Brittany Parker
