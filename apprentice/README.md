# The Apprentice's Path 🌟

Welcome to the beginning of your journey.

## What Is This?

This is a **6-week adventure** where you'll learn to code in Python — not by memorizing boring rules, but by going on quests, building cool projects, and discovering how computers really think.

By the end, you won't just know Python. You'll understand how ALL programming works.

## Who Is This For?

- You've never coded before (or maybe just a little)
- You're curious about how apps, games, and websites are built
- You like stories, games, and building things
- You're ready for a challenge (but a fun one!)

## What You'll Build

| Week | Quest | What You'll Create |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | The Stone Remembers | A secret message encoder |
| 2 | Lightning Paths | A number guessing game |
| 3 | The Pull Between | A quiz game with scores |
| 4 | The Age of Architects | A diagram of your dream app |
| 5 | **Capstone I** | An adventure story game |
| 6 | **Capstone II** | An AI chatbot helper |

## How It Works

1. **Read** the chapter in ROADMAP.md
2. **Learn** the concepts through the story
3. **Complete** the mini-project
4. **Push** your code to your folder
5. **Level up** to the next chapter!
