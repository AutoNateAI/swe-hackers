# Brian's Workspace 🚀

Welcome to your personal learning space! This folder is where all your projects and assignments live.

## How It Works

```
brian/
├── README.md          ← You are here
├── calculator-v1/     ← Your first project folder
│   ├── calculator.py
│   └── notes.md
├── next-project/      ← Future project
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Starting an Assignment

When you get a new card/assignment:

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date
git pull origin main

# Create a folder for the assignment
cd brian
mkdir calculator-v1
cd calculator-v1
```

### 2. Working on Your Code

Create your files, write your code, test it:

```bash
# Create your Python file
touch calculator.py

# Run your code
python calculator.py
```

### 3. Saving Your Progress

Commit early, commit often:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Add basic calculator with + and - operations"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 4. Marking Complete

Once you're done:
1. Push your final code
2. Go to the issue/card on GitHub
3. Check off the "Definition of Done" items
4. Add a comment with any notes or questions

## Tips

- **Commit often** - Small commits are easier to track and undo
- **Write clear commit messages** - Future you will thank present you
- **Ask questions** - Drop comments on the issue if you're stuck
- **Experiment** - Break things, that's how you learn
